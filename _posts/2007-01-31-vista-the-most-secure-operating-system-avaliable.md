So apparently [Windows Vista is "dramatically more secure than any other operating system released"](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6313981.stm)

While I suspect my definition of "secure" is wildly different that of Mr Gates, there are many other [worrying](http://arstechnica.com/articles/paedia/hardware/hdcp-vista.ars) [things](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/10/29/microsoft_vista_eula_analysis/) to consider.

I don't think i'll be leaving my little Linux/BSD/OS X world just yet.
