So after a mate a work started raving about <a href="http://do.davebsd.com/">Gnome Do</a> I decided to give it another go, not quite remembering which I gave up with it last time.

<a href="http://docs.blacktree.com/quicksilver/what_is_quicksilver">Quicksilver</a> is a program I've always installed first when using any Mac and Gnome Do is a very similar thing for Linux.

It wasn't long before I worked out why I had ditched it. I keep switching between window managers and seem to always end up back with <a href="http://pekwm.org">pekwm</a>. Launching Gnome Do in pekwm for some reason causes the "window" to end up behind all the other windows.

A quick RTFM later and I found the answer. In my ~/.pekwm/autoproperties I added:

    Property = "Do,Do" {
            ApplyOn = "Start New Reload"
            Layer   = "Menu"
            Title   = "^Do"
    }

which forces it above all other windows.

With that sorted the only thing left is the occasional erratic behavior of the window placement, but I can live with that for now :)
