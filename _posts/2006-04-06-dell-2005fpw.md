My Dell 2005fpw 20" widescreen TFT arrived today.

Hunting arround there appears to be a few different modelines that people use for it.

After some more digging the most popular seemed to be the following:

<pre>
ModeLine "1680x1050" 146.2 1680 1960 2136 2240 
         1050 1080 1086 1089 -hsync +vsync
</pre>

So the relevent part of /etc/X11/xorg.conf looks like:

<pre>
Section "Modes"
        Identifier "16:10"
        ModeLine "1680x1050" 146.2 1680 1960 2136 2240 
                 1050 1080 1086 1089 -hsync +vsync
&nbsp;
EndSection
Section "Monitor"
        Identifier "dell"
        UseModes "16:10"
        HorizSync 30-83
        VertRefresh 56-75
EndSection
&nbsp;
Section "Screen"
        Identifier "Screen0"
        Device     "Card0"
        Monitor    "dell"
        DefaultDepth 24
        SubSection "Display"
                Depth     24
                Modes "1680x1050" "1280x1024" 
                      "1024x768" "800x600"
                Viewport   0 0
        EndSubSection
EndSection
</pre>
