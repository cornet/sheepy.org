Another one I've just added to my feedlist,

	<a href="http://blog.kovyrin.net/">http://blog.kovyrin.net/</a>

some interesting stuff, especially on the MySQL front.

He is also the author of the MySQL Master-Master Replication Manager
which can be found here:

	<a href="http://code.google.com/p/mysql-master-master/">http://code.google.com/p/mysql-master-master/</a>

definitely something I'll be looking at.
