Another one I've just added to my feedlist,

[http://blog.kovyrin.net/](http://blog.kovyrin.net/)

some interesting stuff, especially on the MySQL front.

He is also the author of the MySQL Master-Master Replication Manager
which can be found here:

[http://code.google.com/p/mysql-master-master/](http://code.google.com/p/mysql-master-master/)

definitely something I'll be looking at.
