Well worth watching if you are at all interested in security.

Its a documentary on the "Security" measures that the british goverment are putting in place, making you think if they are really a "good thing".

For hard core tech people, features include:
<ul>
<li>RFID Exploits (including UK Passports)</li>
<li>CCTV Security</li>
<li>Wireless Security</li>
<li>Mobile Phone exploits</li>
</ul>

Enjoy!
