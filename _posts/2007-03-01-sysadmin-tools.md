There are a number of tools sysadmins should be looking at in order to make their life less hellish when it comes to configuration management.

Some tools that I have found so far are:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.cfengine.org/">cfengine</a></li>
<li><a href="http://reductivelabs.com/projects/puppet/">Puppet</a></li>
<li><a href="http://trac.mcs.anl.gov/projects/bcfg2">Bcfg2</a></li>
</ul>
