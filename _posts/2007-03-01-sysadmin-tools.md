There are a number of tools sysadmins should be looking at in order to make their life less hellish when it comes to configuration management.

Some tools that I have found so far are:

<ul>
<li>[cfengine](http://www.cfengine.org/)</li>
<li>[Puppet](http://reductivelabs.com/projects/puppet/)</li>
<li>[Bcfg2](http://trac.mcs.anl.gov/projects/bcfg2)</li>
</ul>
