So first we have the BT Voyger that gave out your username and password if you <a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/10589/exploit">asked it nicely</a>.

Then, yet again, BT ship a router which another <a href="http://www.gnucitizen.org/blog/bt-home-flub-pwnin-the-bt-home-hub-5">flaw</a> in it.

I've always had this gut feeling that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play">UPnP</a> was bad. It allows machines on your network to modify, for example, settings on your router without any authentication.
