Unfortunately for me I still have to use and administer CVS at work for our developers. Personally I ditched it a long time ago in favour of SVN and then Bazaar.

Lately I've been looking because, well....just because really (us tech's have a habit of trying out things for the hell of it).

So I've decided to commit to using it. I've also gone and got myself a [GitHub account](http://github.com/cornet) which I will use to store configurations, scripts and any public dev work that might be of use.

Will see how it all pans out, I'll hopefully get round to adding more repositories soon.

For now probably the only one worth a look is my [vim configuration](http://github.com/cornet/dotvim/tree/).
Of course you can get a copy by just doing:
<code>
git clone git://github.com/cornet/dotvim.git
</code>
