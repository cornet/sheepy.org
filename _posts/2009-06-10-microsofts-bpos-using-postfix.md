Nice to see MS using opensource software :)

Email received today from someone using BPOS:

     Received: from mail187-tx2-R.bigfish.com (10.9.14.251) by

Looks like bigfish.com are using the <a href="http://www.postfix.org/">Postfix</a> mail server.

Quick whois on bigfish.com reveals:

    Registrant: 
      Microsoft Corporation
      Domain Administrator

Most interesting ;)
