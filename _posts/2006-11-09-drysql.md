Currently investigating this [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org/) thing that everyone is raving about and so far I'm liking it.

[DrySQL](http://drysql.rubyforge.org/) is one of the many examples as to why Rails rocks :)

<blockquote>
DrySQL is a Ruby plug-in that extends ActiveRecord and applies the DRY principle to Object-Relational Mapping.

The idea behind DrySQL is that you define columns, keys, constraints, and relationships on your database, and you shouldn't need to re-define any of these things in your application code.

Shame about this thou...
<blockquote>has_and_belongs_to_many association generation is not implemented at this point </blockquote>

... hopefully it'll be supported soon.
