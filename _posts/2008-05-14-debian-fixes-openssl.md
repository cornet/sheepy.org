So it would appear that Debian "<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=363516">fixed</a>" a problem in OpenSSL a few years ago. Unfortunately this "fix" has meant that they have had to release <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/2008/msg00152.html">this</a> security announcement.

Now this vulnerability is quite bad, so much so that Debian have stated the following:
<blockquote>
It is strongly recommended that all cryptographic key material which has been generated by OpenSSL versions starting with 0.9.8c-1 on Debian systems is recreated from scratch.  Furthermore, all DSA keys ever used on affected Debian systems for signing or authentication purposes should be considered compromised; the Digital Signature Algorithm relies on a secret random value used during signature generation.
</blockquote>

<a href="http://www.links.org">Ben Laurie</a> has posted a great <a href="http://www.links.org?p=327">blog entry</a> as to why this so stupid. This quote from that entry sums the problem up nicely:
<blockquote>
Secondly, if you are going to fix bugs, then you should install this maxim of mine firmly in your head: never fix a bug you donâ€™t understand.
</blockquote>
