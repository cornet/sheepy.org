I'm not the greatest fan of XML for much the same reasons as <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/">Jeff Atwood</a> who wrote a controversial <a href=" http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001114.html">blog post</a> on the subject</a>.

Sometimes though I'm forced to deal with it. <a href="http://xmlstar.sourceforge.net/">XMLStarlet</a> looks like it might relieve some of my frustration.

Thanks to <a href="http://bashcurescancer.com/">BASH Cures Cancer</a> for <a href="http://bashcurescancer.com/the-best-in-command-line-xml-xmlstarlet.html">flagging</a> this.
