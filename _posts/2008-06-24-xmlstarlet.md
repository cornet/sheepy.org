I'm not the greatest fan of XML for much the same reasons as [Jeff Atwood](http://www.codinghorror.com/) who wrote a controversial [blog post]( http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001114.html) on the subject</a>.

Sometimes though I'm forced to deal with it. [XMLStarlet](http://xmlstar.sourceforge.net/) looks like it might relieve some of my frustration.

Thanks to [BASH Cures Cancer](http://bashcurescancer.com/) for [flagging](http://bashcurescancer.com/the-best-in-command-line-xml-xmlstarlet.html) this.
