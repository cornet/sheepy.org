Just found a few scripts that look like they will make the process of ripping a DVD somewhat easier (for backup purposes of course!)
* [undvd](http://www.matusiak.eu/numerodix/blog/index.php/2007/01/30/undvd-dvd-ripping-made-easy/)
* [dvd2mkv](http://wonkabar.org/archives/373)
Although the 2nd one rips to [Matroska](http://www.matroska.org/) format which can play on your phone :)
