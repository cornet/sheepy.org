              product of the table with itself, do i get 6 columns and 9 rows? 
    05:24 <MyName> if the table originally have column names (A B C), do i get ( A
              B C A B C) as the column names after the cartesian product?
    05:24 <MyName> then all the entries are just each entry of the original tables
              with each of the entreis again?
