I've yet _really_ understand Rainbow Tables but [this article](https://www.isc2.org/cgi-bin/content.cgi?page=738) gives a good overview on the subject.

Using this concept [Ophcrack](http://ophcrack.sourceforge.net/) allows you to recover passwords from Windows based machines very quickly (we are talking single figure minutes at the most here) by exploiting the fact that, by default, Windows uses saltless hashes for passwords.

The iso is downloading at the moment and will be put to good use ;)
