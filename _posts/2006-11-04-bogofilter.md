I, and other people on my server, are having SPAM issues again. Spamassassin is great but it eats RAM for breakfast about the same rate it eats SPAM.

After some hunting I think I have found a solution:
<blockquote>Bogofilter              is a mail filter that classifies mail as spam or ham (non-spam)              by a statistical analysis of the message's header and content (body).              The program is able to learn from the user's classifications and              corrections.

Happy SPAM munching.
