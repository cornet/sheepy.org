Somone appears to have created a online storage and sync thing that actually works:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.getdropbox.com/">Dropbox - Home - Secure backup, sync and sharing made easy.</a><br /><br />Few grips thou:<br /><ul><li>It requires nautilus<br /></li><li>Not obvious how to create an account (it's not on the website, the client does it)<br /></li><li>The initial dialog box (which you use to sign up for an account) takes an age to appear</li></ul><br />All that aside it works wonderfully, copy file into ~/Dropbox and it syncs automatically :)<br /><br /><br />... oh and it versions files too<br />... and only sends binary diffs<br /><br />
