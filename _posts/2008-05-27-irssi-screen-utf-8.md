I thought I'd sorted this once but apparently not :(

I'd managed to get things sorted so that I could input pound signs and they would appear fine to me and everyone else but if someone else typed a pound sign I got a question mark.

I *think* what was happening was that it was taking UTF-8 input and converting it to latin1... not entirely sure.

Anyway for those suffering the same issues take a look at [The ultimate guide for UTF-8 in irssi and GNU/Screen](http://www.iovene.com/the-ultimate-guide-for-utf-8-in-irssi-and-gnuscreen/)
